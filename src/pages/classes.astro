Classes
The ETDS has two main categories: Breitensport and ClOpen. Which one you belong to depends on your previous experience in dance competitions.

For more information on the dances you have to dance, the dances page.

Please check the details about ClOpen and about Blind Dating below before you register.


Overview

If you are uncertain which class you belong to, please consult your team captain. In edge cases, the team captain decides where to place the participant fairly. We are happy to give advice to the team captain in case of doubt.

The ETDS committee reserves the right to diverge from the rules stated here to rule in individual cases if conflict should arise.
If a situation arises to which the rules stated here do not (sufficiently) apply, the ETDS committee will decide on the matter. In that case your team captain should contact us.








Breitensport
Based on multiple qualification rounds, Breitensport will be split into a total of 6 classes:
Enthusiasts
Amateurs
Professionals
Masters
Champions
Legends
After the qualification rounds, the tournament will continue with preliminary rounds, the quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals. It is not planned to have a redance in any category.

Blind Dating
Blind dating means that you find a dance partner on site on Friday evening. It is a lot of fun to dance a competition with a partner with whom you do not dance regularly, and who might even be from another country! We highly recommend it, since it is a great way to connect to other teams.

In Breitensport, blind dating is voluntary or mandatory depending on your previous competition experience. Please check the classes overview. In ClOpen, there is no blind dating as the partner lottery starts already in the qualification round.

You can find different partners for Standard and Latin. The main blind dating round will be on Friday for Standard and Latin. There will be a second blind dating round for Latin on Saturday evening.

ClOpen
For ClOpen, there will be a lottery system instead of blind dating. This lottery determines for each round and for each dance which partner you will dance with.
Based on multiple qualification rounds, ClOpen will be split into a total of 2 classes:
CloseD
Open

After the qualification rounds, the tournament will continue with preliminary rounds, the quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals. It is not planned to have a redance in any category.

If you dance this ClOpen in one discipline (Ballroom or Latin), this does not affect your other discipline.

Assessment by Team Captain
Dancers in fields marked with " * " (e.g. D-Class*) and additionally dancers from equality tournaments generally start with mandatory BlindDating in Breitensport.
Based on experience and performance in previous tournaments, the team captain of the participant's team will choose if the dancer is allowed to start in ClOpen.
The same applies to dancers who have never competed in the desired section (std./lat.) but have reached the highest class in the other.

Blind Dating
Blind dating means that you find a dance partner on site on Friday evening. It is a lot of fun to dance a competition with a partner with whom you do not dance regularly, and who might even be from another country! We highly recommend it, since it is a great way to connect to other teams.


In Breitensport, blind dating is voluntary or mandatory depending on your previous competition experience. Please check the classes overview. In ClOpen, there is no blind dating as the partner lottery starts already in the qualification round.


You can find different partners for Standard and Latin. The main blind dating round will be on Friday for Standard and Latin. There will be a second blind dating round for Latin on Saturday evening.


For the blind dating, the floor is going to be divided so that you can go to the area corresponding to your level. This will facilitate finding a partner whose level matches yours. Music will play for short periods of time (30 to 60 seconds), after which you will switch to a new partner. Once two people agree that they want to compete together, you can come to the info desk to register as a couple.

Blind Dating Rules
The following rules apply:

Voluntary blind daters have no restrictions on their partner.
Mandatory blind daters have the following restrictions:
You cannot blind date someone with whom, in the past 3 years, you have competed (ETDS, NTDS, other competition, etc.) or trained together.
You cannot blind date someone from your own team.
Mandatory blind dating only applies to your usual role as lead/follow. If you register to dance in the opposite role then blind dating is voluntary.
